ipv6: sysctl to restrict candidate source addresses

Per RFC 6724, section 4, "Candidate Source Addresses":

    It is RECOMMENDED that the candidate source addresses be the set
    of unicast addresses assigned to the interface that will be used
    to send to the destination (the "outgoing" interface).

Add a sysctl to enable this behaviour.
